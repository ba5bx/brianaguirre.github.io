Hi, my name is Brian N. Aguirre Parada. I am a *Math* and <*Computer Science* major at Northern Virginia Community College. I have been accepted to **UVA's School of Engineering**, but I am currently applying to a couple of other schools in California.

Currently, in addition to have been the founder of the first Computer Science club at NOVA, I am working on founding a non-profit that specilizes in helping other immigrants attend college by founding scholarships and grants that are not legal-status based.
Here is a <a href="{{ site.url}}/resume.pdf"> *resume*</a> for my recent work.


## Some facts about me:

I got married at the age of 18.

I read math text books for fun.

I run and bike almost every day.

I speak fluent Spanish, proficient French and taught myself basic Italian.

I enjoy memorizing city maps.
